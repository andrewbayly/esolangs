## dougal
 dougal is a programming language which was created to explore what happens if you remove the control statements from JavaScript. What do you need to do to keep the language operational? Can it be Turing Complete?
 
## quine_test
 Originally, quine_test was intended to be a series of languages, each of which was a transformation of JavaScript, in which it was increasingly difficult to write quines. However, there was a surprise when I built qt1 - ANY language which is a direct transformation of JavaScript admits a very simple quine. All you do is to implement a function in the quine which encodes the source.
