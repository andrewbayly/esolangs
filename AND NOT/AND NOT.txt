AND NOT
-------

AND NOT is a language in which we define a circuit made from AND NOT gates. 

In AND NOT, we have outputs and inputs. Outputs are defined to be 1 or 0 initially, depending
on a value given on the gate line. 

First, we calculate Inputs by looking at outputs, and finding connected inputs, and copying values. 
Then we calculate outputs by looking at Inputs, and performing ANO NOT Operations. 

Output
------
The initial 1 that is available on an output gate is ignored. We begin counting generations
from the end of the generation when the next value is generated. 

Notation
--------
Each line in the AND NOT Machine program represents an AND NOT gate. With a, b and o ports, 
and also an associated State.
